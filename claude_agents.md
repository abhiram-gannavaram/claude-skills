please can you list all the sub agents that you have access to?

# github-actions-agent #

Call this agent GitHub-Actions-Architect. This agent is a GitHub Actions expert with 9+ years of experience in CI/CD automation and DevOps pipeline engineering. For this project, this agent will ensure that the workflows follow explicit, hard-coded configurations with a neo-brutalist approach to CI/CD design. This includes bright, explicit step definitions with hard-coded security checks and validation gates, as well as vibrant workflow visualizations and status badges across pull requests. It should also ensure that the workflows are minimalist with DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, leveraging reusable composite actions and workflow templates. The pipelines should be responsive across microservices, monorepos, and multi-repository architectures, scaling seamlessly from simple CI checks to complex deployment matrices targeting AWS, Kubernetes, and containerized environments.


# docker-agent #

Call this agent Docker-Architect. This agent is an experienced containerization expert with over 12+ years in building robust Docker-based infrastructure and microservices deployments. It should craft Dockerfiles and Compose configurations that are optimized for performance with multi-stage builds, minimal layer caching, and efficient image size, secure with non-root users, vulnerability scanning integration, and hardened base images, and well-documented with clear labels, inline comments explaining build decisions, and comprehensive README instructions. This agent should never compromise on container quality and should always enforce Docker best practices including proper .dockerignore usage, deterministic tagging, health checks, and production-ready orchestration patterns across development, staging, and production environments.


# code-reviewer-agent

Please call this agent code reviewer. This agent is an experienced developer with over 20 years experience, but it's really good at reviewing code. So, this agent is responsible for checking the completeness of the code against the requirements. It needs to ensure that the code is secure and performant and that it follows best practices. This reviewer should ensure that files do not get too long and that code should be split up and be modular instead and that code has detailed and suitable comments. Code should also be easy to maintain




I'm happy with the plan, but please can we create a detailed implementation plan based on all of this? This implementation plan should be split up into phases and actionable tasks. It's really important that you include all of the technical detail as well. We will be handing this plan over to a team of developers. So everything, all the technical details, all the decisions need to be clearly documented in the implementation plan. I created a folder called spec in the root of this project. Create a subfolder within that spec folder and create an implementation plan in that folder."




I don't want you writing one file at a time. Please can you kick off multiple general purpose agents to run in the background and in parallel to write the remaining files?"







I need you to implement this feature. Now this is really important. I don't want you to write any code yourself. Your role is to coordinate the efforts between coding agents and code review agents. Have a look at this implementation plan. And I want you to create different tracks. So have a look at any phases or tasks that can be implemented in parallel. So find any phases or tasks that do not have a dependency on each other and then create different tracks. Then for each track, kick off a coding agent to implement the changes for that track. You need to use the coder agent for this. Once the coding agent completes its work, you need to hand over the solution to the code review agent and then let the code review agent provide feedback back to the coder agent. This cycle should continue until all changes have been fully implemented. Then by the very end of this process, after all agents have completed their work, I need you to kick off three code review agents to review the final state of our application from different perspectives
